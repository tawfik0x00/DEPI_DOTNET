Design ERD & DB Schema 

A company wants to develop a Product Management System to store and manage information about its products and related business operations.

The system should keep track of products, where each product has a unique identifier, name, description, price, and manufacturing date, and each product must belong to exactly one category.

Categories are used to classify products and include a unique category ID, name, and description, with each category possibly containing many products.

The system must also manage suppliers, where each supplier has a unique ID, name, phone number, and address, and suppliers may supply multiple products while a product may be supplied by multiple suppliers.

Products are stored in warehouses, and each warehouse has a unique ID, location, and capacity; a product may be stored in multiple warehouses, and each warehouse may store many products, with the quantity of each product tracked per warehouse.

The system should handle customer orders, where each order has a unique order ID, order date, and status, and an order may contain multiple products with specified quantities and unit prices.

Order items cannot exist without their corresponding orders and products, ensuring data integrity throughout the system.
